# üåê Project-Learning-Outcome

This project leveraged a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript techniques to achieve a visually appealing and functional form. Below is a summary of the key learnings and skills honed throughout this project:

### HTML Structure and Form Creation

- **Basic HTML Structure**: Set up the foundational HTML elements, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Linking CSS and Fonts**: Linked an external CSS file and Google Fonts in the `<head>` section using `<link>` tags.
- **Form Elements**: Created a form with various input fields such as `text`, `email`, `tel`, and `password`.
- **Grouping Fields**: Grouped form fields using `<div>` elements to align them side by side within the form.

### CSS Styling

- **Basic Styling**: Applied basic styles to the `body` and other elements using CSS, including properties like `margin`, `padding`, `display`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`.
- **Container Styling**: Styled the container to center it on the page and gave it specific dimensions using percentage values and `vh` units.
- **Rectangle Styling**: Styled the rectangle that contains the form and background image, including using `border-radius` to round the corners and `overflow: hidden` to ensure child elements respect the rounded corners.
- **Background Image and Blur Effect**: Set a background image for an element and applied a blur effect using the `background-image` and `filter` properties.
- **Positioning Elements**: Positioned elements absolutely within their parent containers using `position: absolute`, and centered elements using `top`, `left`, and `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`.
- **Form Styling**: Styled form elements, including input fields and buttons, using CSS properties like `padding`, `margin`, `border`, `border-radius`, `background-color`, `color`, and `hover` effects.

### HTML Attributes for Form Validation

- **Input Types**: Specified different input types using the `type` attribute (e.g., `text`, `email`, `tel`, `password`).
- **Validation Attributes**: Used validation attributes like `required` to ensure fields are filled out, and `pattern` and `inputmode` to enforce specific input formats (e.g., ensuring the phone number field only accepts numeric input).

### JavaScript for Input Validation

- **Event Listeners**: Added event listeners to input fields to dynamically enforce validation rules.
- **Regular Expressions**: Used regular expressions within JavaScript to filter out unwanted characters from input fields.
